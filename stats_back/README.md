# The Backend (stats_back)
This is the REST API written with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [express](https://expressjs.com/). 
It serves all info from the mongodb to be used for whatever (i.e. the frontend). This API is also used 
to catch and return the data when a new user logs in using Github.
